This is a blog series about functional programming with Elm.


## Why start programming with Elm?
I am a software engineer for a long time and have been programming in an Object Oriented way my whole career, mostly in Java. I like discovering new things and for a time that was mostly Java related. But while there was a lot of development around Java(not much in the language itself), it felt like more of the same. A new librtary here and there but mostly on known concepts. When I learned to program for the frontend, a whole new world opened. It felt like Java in the early days. Lots of frameworks and libraries popping up, great. 

### Functional programming
Lots of these new frameworks and libraries were about functional programming. Even Java received functional programming features. They were easy to use, albeit in a different way. It peaked my interest, what is that, real functional programming? By the way it is not a new concept. it exists for a long time, but somehow it is popping up everywhere. So I wanted to do functional programming. But where and in what language? I could go for the backend (there are multiple candidates, like frege and eta), but I choose the frontend, because I needed a more stable framework/language

## What is Elm?


## The goal
The goal is to make a desktop application that can read json files from the file system and can display it on the screen. That means not only the challenge of learning Elm, but also to create an application with electron and Elm.

{% highlight java %}
    Observable.just("Hello observable without backpressure")
    .filter(text -> text.startsWith("Hello"))
    .subscribe(System.out::println);
{% endhighlight %}
